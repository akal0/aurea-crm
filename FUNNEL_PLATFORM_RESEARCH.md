     - CRM built-in
     - Workflow automation
     - Multi-channel communication
   - Single source of truth for all customer data

6. **Performance Obsessed**

### Database Schema Recommendations

#### Events Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE funnel_events (
  id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  event_id UUID UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  
  -- Context
  funnel_id TEXT,
  subaccount_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  session_id UUID NOT NULL,
  
  -- Event data
  event_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  event_properties JSONB,
  
  -- User data
  user_id TEXT,
  anonymous_id UUID,
  user_properties JSONB,
  
  -- Technical
  page_url TEXT,
  page_title TEXT,
  referrer TEXT,
  utm_params JSONB,
  
  -- Timestamps
  timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  server_timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  
  -- Indexes for fast queries
  INDEX idx_funnel_events_funnel_id (funnel_id, timestamp DESC),
  INDEX idx_funnel_events_session (session_id),
  INDEX idx_funnel_events_user (user_id, timestamp DESC),
  INDEX idx_funnel_events_subaccount (subaccount_id, timestamp DESC)
);
```

#### Sessions Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE funnel_sessions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  
  -- Context
  subaccount_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  funnel_id TEXT,
  user_id TEXT,
  anonymous_id UUID,
  
  -- Session data
  started_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
  ended_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  duration_seconds INTEGER,
  
  -- Attribution
  first_source TEXT,
  first_medium TEXT,
  first_campaign TEXT,
  first_referrer TEXT,
  
  -- Metrics
  page_views INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  events_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  converted BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  conversion_value DECIMAL(10,2),
  
  -- Technical
  ip_address INET,
  user_agent TEXT,
  country_code TEXT,
  device_type TEXT,
  
  INDEX idx_sessions_subaccount (subaccount_id, started_at DESC),
  INDEX idx_sessions_funnel (funnel_id, started_at DESC),
  INDEX idx_sessions_user (user_id, started_at DESC)
);
```

#### Funnel Analytics Table (Aggregated)
```sql
CREATE TABLE funnel_analytics_daily (
  id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  
  date DATE NOT NULL,
  funnel_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  subaccount_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  
  -- Traffic metrics
  sessions INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  unique_visitors INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  page_views INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  
  -- Conversion metrics
  conversions INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  conversion_rate DECIMAL(5,2),
  
  -- Revenue metrics
  revenue DECIMAL(10,2),
  average_order_value DECIMAL(10,2),
  
  -- Attribution
  source TEXT,
  medium TEXT,
  campaign TEXT,
  
  UNIQUE (date, funnel_id, subaccount_id, source, medium, campaign)
);
```
